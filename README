(f)SELF loader via server (fPKG application)

Prerequisites:
	Kernel payload changes & ShellCore patches:
		https://gist.github.com/flatz/f510bc6647a33cef1532c65c7881f32d

	SDK (oouch! need to move to open source SDK in the future...)
	Publishing tools with fPKG patches

	Linux & Wine (I'm building it on trueOS but it could be backported to Windows)

Notices:
	Jailbreaking/rooting requires custom syscall which does that (see jailbreak.c).
